# Personal-Finance-Dashboard

This is a simple web application built using **Flask**, a Python web framework, to track transactions. The app allows users to add transactions with details like amount, category, and date, and view a dashboard of all transactions. It stores transactions in a **Linked List** data structure.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Users can submit transaction details like amount, category, and date.
- **View Transactions**: All transactions are displayed on a dashboard, where users can see the list of all added transactions.
- **Data Storage**: Transactions are stored in a linked list, demonstrating the use of custom data structures.
- **Responsive Frontend**: The app uses HTML and CSS for the frontend, designed to be simple and responsive.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Data Structure**: Transaction Linked List (custom implementation)
- **Database**: None (transactions stored in memory using a linked list)

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transaction-tracker.git
cd transaction-tracker
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Homepage: You can add a new transaction by filling in the amount, category, and date, and clicking "Submit."
Dashboard: All added transactions will be displayed in a list with their details.
Custom Data Structure: TransactionLinkedList
The transactions are stored in a TransactionLinkedList (custom linked list), which is defined in the models/transaction.py file. The linked list allows us to manage transactions dynamically as they are added.

Transaction Linked List Methods:
add_transaction(amount, category, date): Adds a new transaction to the list.
get_all_transactions(): Retrieves all the transactions stored in the list.

### Notes:
- **Project Title**: Make sure to replace `Transaction Tracker App` with the actual name of your project if it's different.
- **Repository URL**: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/transaction-tracker.git` with your actual repository URL.
- **Tech Stack**: Adjust if you decide to use any additional tools or frameworks (e.g., React).
- **Custom Data Structure**: I've included some explanation for the `TransactionLinkedList`, but you can expand it based on your implementation.

This should give a solid overview and setup for anyone interested in using or contributing to your project! ðŸ˜Š
